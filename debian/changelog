debathena-locker (1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sigh.  Depend on a specific version of libperl4-corelibs-perl, because
    upstream decided it was a good idea for perl-modules to Provide: this
    package in the interim.  In theory, we don't care, and things will
    work when Ubuntu actually drops perl4 support, but in reality, it
    causes confusing errors for users.  (Trac: #1188)
